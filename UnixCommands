Steps to SSH from host to guest.

1. Get the host ip address
$ip addr show

2. Try to ping from guest terminal to see its working.
$ping 192.168.1.145

3. Check if SSH service is running on the guest. 
$netstat -lnpt | grep 22
netstat --> network statistics
l --> display listening server sockets
n --> numeric
p --> PID/program for sockets
t --> tcp
port 22 is for SSH
it should show
tcp   0  0  0.0.0.0:22  0.0.0.0:*  LISTEN  -

4. Can do SSH in guest itself with itself
$ssh 127.0.0.1

5. Check if port 22 is blocked in firewall/iptables.
$iptables -nvL INPUT

6. Following command fixes, if internet is not working in host machine.
$sudo dfhclient -v

7. First ping from guest. If it is working then connect using ssh
$ping 192.168.1.145
$ssh 192.168.1.145
